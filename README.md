# qseecom_modifications
Modifications in the qseecom driver which enable FuzzZone to operate

# Description

This repository contains the modifications to the MSM kernel which are needed in order to enable the FuzzZone application to send crafted SCM calls to TrustZone.

I've uploaded the original files under "original" and their modified versions under "modified". The files match the MSM kernel for hammerhead:4.4.4/KTU84P, but feel free to copy the changes to whichever kernel you're working on.
